this was cheat that i used in genshin impact. it has entity ESP, including chest, and material. 
i forgot what version but it was the first time when Yelan appear, maybe 2.3?. 
the cheat might be not working because update and you might look up different offset by yourself.
because the game using Unity engine so you can use IL2CPP dumper.

the game use myhprot2 for its anti-cheat (i heard they use mhyprot3 recently) i dont know what the difference yet.
