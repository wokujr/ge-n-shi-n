this was cheat that i used in genshin impact. it has entity ESP like chest, enemy, and material. 
i forgot what version but it was the first time when Yelan appear, maybe 2.3?. 
the cheat might be not working due to updates and you might look up different offsets by yourself.
the game using Unity engine, you can use IL2CPP dumper to make your life easier.

the game use myhprot2 for its anti-cheat (i heard they use mhyprot3 recently) i dont know what the difference yet.
